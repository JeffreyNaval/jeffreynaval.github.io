### Pygments Issue
Pygments the highlighter that github is using, does not have Python 3 support.
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb/issues/45)

## Highlightjs
If you don't want to deal with setting Jekyll markdown you can just leave your `_config.yml` with it's default settings and leave code highlighting to [Highlightsjs](https://highlightjs.org/)

### Jekyll Now
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) is good for starting your blog without the hussle of setting up Jekyll locally.
