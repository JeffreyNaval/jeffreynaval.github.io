title: Setting Gulp, Bower, Bootstrap, Sass, Fontawesome
---

I've been searching for a quick guide on how to setup `Gulp`, `Bower`, `Bootstrap`, `Sass` and `Fontawesome`.
Then I found [Eric L. Barnes blog](http://ericlbarnes.com/setting-gulp-bower-bootstrap-sass-fontawesome/).
The problem is it's outdated and some settings are not available like `loadPath` on `Sass`.
And `bootstrap-sass-official` is now `bootstrap-sass`.

@TODO point how to use .bowerrc to copy fonts after bower install.
